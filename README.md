#### My name is Yun-Pu Yang. I am a PhD student in Theater and Performance Studies. I am working towards the Graduate Certificate in Digital Humanities. I haven't made a decision about my final project yet, but it is highly likely that I'll work on analyses of newspaper articles published between 1920-30. My objecrtives for the class include polishing one of my two DH projects and developing self-study abilities in Python after this class.
